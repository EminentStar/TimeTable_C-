*WARNING*
It is absolutely better that you never use 'static' access modifier everywhere like classes, methods, variables etc.
When you declare a static class or something, these kinda things are stored some memory space.
Anyway, Cho-rong said that just don't use 'static' access modifier.

*Feedback*
First, you've gotta finish just simple implementation 
without contemplating exceptions. And then, let you handle exceptions gradually.

*Supplement Points*
